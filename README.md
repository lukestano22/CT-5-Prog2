# Recursive Product Calculator (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that demonstrates the use of **recursion** to calculate the **product of five user-entered numbers**.

## 🧠 Overview

The program prompts the user to enter five integers and then calculates the product of those numbers using a recursive method. This is a great example for understanding how recursion works with arrays and how base and recursive cases are implemented.

## 📂 Features

- Accepts exactly **5 integers** from the user.
- Uses **recursion** to compute the product.
- Displays the final result in the console.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Scanner class for user input
- Basic recursion
